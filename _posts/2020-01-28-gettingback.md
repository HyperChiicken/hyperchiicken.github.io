The New Year has begun whether you are on the lunar or solar calendar. It's refreshing to imagine that I am on a fresh new canvas, ready to be ruined yet again. Now that's positive thinking! Anyways, I've seen myself slack off on my personal growth and hobbies due to work. It's too easy to just relax (aka sleep) as soon as I get home. But I have been getting better as my body gets used to the work load. I'm back drawing/sketching/doodling albeit weekly for now. I've also finished some gunpla and plamo models as well. So yeah, I'm definitely getting back in the groove!
