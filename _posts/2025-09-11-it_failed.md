The cornea transplant failed. Basically, the graft that was attached to my left eye is no logner attached. So now I need to undergo the same surgery with a few twists. They need to deepen the inner chamber of my eye through Vitrectomy (again). Then, add some gel to clog the new shunt pipe on that regulates the liquid flow in my eye. Doing this will prevent the air bubble that will placed to keep the new cornea transplant in place.

My doctors deemed this an urgent surgery. So naturally, I have to cancel everything and go through with it. There's no workaround this time. It sucks to have planned things in advance only to flush it all away last minute. Somehow, I'm not completely devastated. Life has been giving me curve balls like this throughout my life that things like this no longer surprise me. I learned to catch what life throws at me, one way or another. It really is easy to just give up and take the hit -- this weighs on me everyday. I'm just glad there's still a fight in me with the help of my support structure, of course -- family, friends, fiancee, pet, doctors, counselors, and therapists.

I hope the surgery goes as planned this time around.
