Meet <b>ARMin</b>, my robot arm. If you're thinking that sounds like a character from <b>"<i>Attack on Titans</i>"</b> then you are correct! I was about to return him to amazon.com after completing this mini-project since the servos aren't that great (low torque = can't do a lot of practical things). I decided to keep him after naming him which was a mistake. Anyways, he's part of the robo-family now. I'll be adding modifications with him soon. Maybe turn him into a shoulder robot-arm pet/pal/companion thing. 

For now, it's time to do a write-up and a mini-tutorial to help quick-start other people's projects. <b>:D</b>
