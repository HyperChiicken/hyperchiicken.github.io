I leveled up in age yesterday. I get to add another number because I managed to survive another year. And what a year it has been so far! It's also been almost a year since I started working, and it seems like I made strides. I built things and made things work. At the same time, I feel ike these things are just a drop in the sea. A little speck of so-called "achievement." It still takes me a while to get tasks done, which makes me think if I'm cut out for this kind of work. I thought coding and toubleshooting was my bread-and-butter, but I've been having doubts.The question still stands: what am I really good at? 

I feel stuck, but I've been looking into things I haven't tried yet like creating a lofi channel (including animation), wall climbing (if they're even open), game creation (using game maker studio 2), and voice overs (of what though?). These are the things I'd like to tackle all of them though it's probably best to focus one. OR I can just time block and do them all at once anyways. Hmmmm......
