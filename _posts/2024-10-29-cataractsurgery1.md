Hmm, the *__chronosphere's__* dual motivator tank combusters seems to have blown a gasket. The logic synchronizer also seem to be out of wack. The time slip was definitely a significant one this time around. 

This arc has been another rollercoaster ride. I underwent my first cataract surgery that was supposed to be a simple operation has become an endeavour. The doctor said it's supposed to be a quick surgery and recovery -- a one hour surgery with a 2 day recovery time; not for me. I had to go a pre-surgery surgery called vitrectomy where they suck the juices out my eye so the anterior chamber (front chamber of the eye) can have more space. It's a prerequisite so that the doctor has more space to work with when the actual cataract surgery is done. The cataract surgery took roughly 2 hours and the recovery was definitely not ideal. I had to visit the doctor's office everyday for a whole week because my eye pressure was through the roof. An all time high of 54mmHg (my normal is 11mmHg)! The pressure has normalized, but it's creeping back up again. There's an edema thing going on now that makes things cloudy/murky on my left eye. New medications has been prescribed to my already long list to (hopefully) fix things.

It's hard to get motivated with the my vision being so unpredictable. I know I can't control it. So I'm still pushing through with what I do have control over. I hope I can hold on this courage to push through these times. Never fear.
