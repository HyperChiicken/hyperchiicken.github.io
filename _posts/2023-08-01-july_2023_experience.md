** __*Chronosphere*__ *spinning* *into* *existence*** 

Well well well, another uneventful month. I just remember taking a whole week off during the July 4 holiday to reset. I guess I also worked on a bunch of fight sticks to get ready for Street Fighter 6. I succesfully made one out of a cardboard box and played maybe an hour. Then a whole lot of unmemorable things happened. 

Hopefully, this month won't be as meh. With that I leave you with a haiku:

<h2 align="center"> Haiku about July </h2>	

<p align="center">*July just went by.*</p>

<p align="center">*What the heck even happened?*</p>

<p align="center">*Urgh, no idea.*</p>
