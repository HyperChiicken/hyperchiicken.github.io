&ensp;&ensp;I decided to trade my new3DSXL for someone's PSvita slim on a game trading website (gametz.com). It was a bit bittersweet to let go of an old friend, but I haven't really gamed on it for a long time. So I thought I'd give the PSvita a go. Thus, my journey to modify my new old PSvita slim from <b>3.70</b> to <b>3.65enso</b>.

&ensp;&ensp;Modifying a 3.70 original firmware (<b>OFW</b>) has not been possible until lately when theFlow released the <b>Trinity hack</b>. The hack uses a vulnerability in the PSP emulation. It basically uses an official PSP demo found on the PSN store, mess with the files within, then converts it into the <b>Trinity hack</b>. This allows the <b>henkaku</b> and <b>VitaShell</b> to be installed on the PSvita with a 3.70 OFW.

&ensp;&ensp;In order to get the <b>Trinity hack</b> working. I had to go install serveral things on my computer and on the PSvita itself. This was the easy part. Thanks to this guide: <a href="https://psvitamod.com/trinity-hack-for-3-69-3-70/">https://psvitamod.com/trinity-hack-for-3-69-3-70/</a>. After that was working, it was time to install <b>modoru</b> using this guide: <a href="https://psvitamod.com/modoru-downgrade-the-ps-vita/">https://psvitamod.com/modoru-downgrade-the-ps-vita/</a>. This package downgrades the PSvita from <b>3.70 OFW</b> to <b>3.65 OFW</b> or other firmware of your choosing.

<b>3.65 OFW! AWWW YEAAH!</b> Now all I need to do is open <b>VitaShell</b> to activate <b>henkaku</b> again and install <b>enso</b>. <b>WROOOOONG!!!</b> The downgrade actually affected the install of <b>VitaShell</b>, which means I need to redo my installation of it. So I treated this part as if I'm just modifying a fresh <b>3.65 OFW</b> PSvita from scratch.

Following the README file from theFlow's official h-encore repository got me there (<a href="https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/h-encore">https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/h-encore</a>). This made my <b>VitaShell</b> usable again. So I just transferred the <i><b>enso.vpk</b></i> from my computer to the PSvita. This is the one I used: <a href="https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/enso/releases/tag/v1.1">https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/enso/releases/tag/v1.1</a> . I got caught with some errors initally with this because the link I downloaded from was for <b>3.60 OFW</b>. <b>>__O</b> So make sure you're downloading the right/compatible version!

Installing the package will grant you the coveted <b>3.65enso</b> custom firmware (<b>CFW</b>). <b>Now the real fun begins! :D</b>
