Woooosh! Time slipped again, and it's now the end of the fiscal year! I feel like I haven't accomplished anything, but it's worth celebrating (maybe). Anyways, I'm still in this bubble of stress where it's not likely to burst anytime soon. Work will always be work I guess.

Moving on, my vision is never going to get better. The last eye specialist I saw pretty much ended with this: <b>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</b>. So what should I do now? Here's a good list:
* Be depressed forever
* Be depressed forever and be okay with it
* Adventure time! Make the most of what's left

So I already done the first two. I honestly don't like it, but I think I'll just have to live it; or talk to a therapist (not sure how helpful that's going to be). Looks like I just got to make most of what's left. It's a struggle to get back to my neurotic artistic mood of past, but this is the only way! Step by step. Hope for the best. Dream on!
