My cornea transplant redo has a better turn out this time! It's still attached after 3 weeks so that's good. What's better is that I'm starting to be able to read letters albeit giant sized ones. The interesting this time around was that I could see the "bubble" that was existing in my left eye. It was a black blob, that pretty jiggly -- like a LocoRoco, an old Playstation Portable game that got remastered for the PS4. It didn't really bother me as much due to me just lying down on my bed (as recomendded by my doctor). But when I did get up and start walking, it would just dance around my vision playfully/annoyingly. Sometimes it would split up into 2, 3, 4, then join back up again into one big blob, just like em LocoRoco! A few days out, it just vanished (as expected). I kinda miss it. I'll probably see em again when they operate on my right eye next. Yay? Urgh.
