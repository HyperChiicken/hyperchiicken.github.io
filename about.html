## About

### The Academic

So. Much. Studying. I feel like the bulk of my life was spent on academia. You know, learning how to learn. I chose to pursue Electrical Engineering, which didn't feel quite right. So I went ahead and got my Master's degree on it just to make sure that it really isn't for me. As of today, I'm still not sure. But what I did find out is this: I love learning through projects, by making.

### The Maker

It's rewarding to see one of your prototypes at work, but getting to that moment is painful. Building something from nothing literally takes a lot of time. The cycle of implementing and debugging until it works is frustrating at best. Yet I still push forward because every hurdle is a lesson waiting to be learned. And overcoming all the hurdles brings you to the goal of a (kindda) completed project.

### The Artist

I like cute and cool looking things. Someday I'd like to marry them together and have something like chibi chihuahuas wearing mecha armor. In the meantime, I'm just drawing random doodles/comics as some sort of a journal.
