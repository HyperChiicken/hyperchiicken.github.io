Welp, I just underwent another surgery. Not for the cornea transplant though, but a whole 'nother thing that's unexpected. Apparently the "bleb" or that thing that they put on my left eye ball is no longer working properly. My internal eye pressure went up and wouldn't go down despite a slew of new oral and ophthalmic medication. So they had to go in and do a thing called an "Ahmed Shunt" surgery. This where the doctor creates a new pathway for the liquid for my eye to flow through to maintain the desired intraocular pressure of ~10mmHg. I've recovered now, but my vision is still crappy as always. I hope the cornea transplant that my team of doctors are planning again will get some of my vision back. Gotta think positive (as my therapist says).
