It's been 2 weeks after I got my second COVID shot. They said it's "safe" to go back to normal activities (according to the CDC anyways). Somehow I feel weird because spending most of my time indoors has been my norm even before the pandemic. Now I'll be that weird person who never goes out! Whatever! Though, I did go out this past weekend to try out something new: pottery. 

There's a small mom and pop studio in town called "Not Made in China" that's all about making things with clay. Going in, I was expecting to use the "wheel" where you spin the clay into shape with the help of a high-speed rotary device. We ended up doing the beginner class that involved shaping the clay only without the fancy machinery. The gist of the steps are the following:

<p style="text-align: left">
	
* Create a ball of clay by tossing it to your palm repeatedly.&nbsp;
	
* Once it's smooth, slam it down! Albeit in a controlled fashion--again, repeatedy.&nbsp;

* When you have a flat, oval shaped clay. Lay your handy-dandy sticks on both edges and start rolling--again, repeatedly.&nbsp;

* Replace the handy-dandy sticks with smaller handy-dandy sticks then start rolling--again, repeatedly... you get my point.&nbsp;

* Slice the clay into a rectangle with a sharp stick and smoothen with a damp sponge.&nbsp;

* Select a pipe (I chose a small one) and roll it against your flat clay. Make a mark a little bit after where they meet.&nbsp;

* Create cross-hatching looking pattern on both sides then apply "slip" on both of them (imagine making a velcro).&nbsp;

* Stick them together by pressing them firmly against each other.&nbsp;

* Create the bottom with the left over clay.&nbsp;

* Cut the shape and again cross-hatch, apply "slip", and stick them together!&nbsp;

* Do the same method if you want a handle.&nbsp;

We ended our day with raw creations: a big mug and 2 cute little pitcher-looking things. This still needs to be "fired" up and glazed to reach their final form (we don't get to these things, I think). The whole process was relaxing; just zoning out and making 'em! So much so that I signed up for a month long membership. My mission is to make a fat pot/mug with a chicken design. There is a LOT to learn before I reach my goal, but I'm excited to go through the process (for once). Here we go~
