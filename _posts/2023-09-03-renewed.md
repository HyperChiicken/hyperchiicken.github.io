It's hard to get things back from the way it was -- the days of amazement and joy. My vision is waning, and it's never going to get better. I feel stuck. However, I want to get out of this hole. I finally went to a therapist and been going consistently. It has been hard for me to open up, but I think I'm making progress. I'm able to figure things out with my therapist's help. Everything still looks bleak though. I hope I get to see a bit of light at the end of the tunnel soon.
