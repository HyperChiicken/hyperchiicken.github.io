My little not so little box of happiness came in last week! I got a Yuki Nagato from the anime, Haruhi Suzumiya, and a bunch of Kancolle nendoroids. Look at em cuties sitting with the kotatsu as we close in towards summer time. You can blame this to all the Tiktoks, Instagram vids, and Youtube haul unboxings I watched. I jumped into the bandwagon and paid the price ~$200 with shipping already included. I went on a rampage cuz (1) they were cute, and (2) they were cheap. It's definitely a blow to my wallet, but was it worth it? Maybe not... but I enjoyed the unboxing moment, posing them, and making a little diorama as seen on the pic!
