Complications. My cornea was not that happy 6 weeks after the surgery. My ophthamoligists said it could have been because of "decompensation." It's one of those things where my eye had too much surgery, and it be like "fuck this shit; I'm out." They said it's slowly dying. Great...

So things are hazy once again. It's like having a cataract, but the cornea version. They recommended 2 more surgeries. The first one is to fix my eye pressure because the thing that was regulating it, the "bleb" (I know so many technical medical terms), is no longer working good. The second one is transplanting a new cornea. These things don't sound cheap... if only I had an infinite money glitch/cheatcode.

My antidepressant is definitely keeping me afloat when it comes to processing this new arc of my life. Without the meds and my theraphy sessions, I think I'll be waaaay down in the dumps or worse. What's a chicken gotta do to get a break around here? I'm looking at you winter break. (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و
