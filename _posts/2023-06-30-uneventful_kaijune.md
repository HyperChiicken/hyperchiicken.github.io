The ** __*chronosphere*__ **  decided to stop at the end of the month, which is fine. Nothing eventful really happened. Days really just intermingled with each other. I wastched some anime here and there like "Bocchi the Rock" -- I haven't laughed so hard in a long time -- such a precious anime! It's quite inspirational too; it makes you want to strive at being really good at something. But it wasn't inspirational enough for me to go and hone my skills at something. Then there's Demon Slayer which is badass as always. Finally, Oshi no Ko -- dayummm -- the first episode is (fire) (fire) (fire)! The story winds down a bit as it progressed but still holds your interest all the way to the end.

It was a lazy month but still so much hype. AAA games are coming out left and right (ie. Street Fighter 6, Final Fantasy 16, etc.) plus announcements of "new" games coming out (ie. Star Ocean 2 remake, Super Mario RPG remake, etc.). I don't normally get excited with remasters and remakes but these ones had me giddy. Should I just hope that the chronosphere zaps me forward to November? Maybe...
