## Haiku about July

*July just went by.*

*What the heck even happened?*

*Urgh, no idea.*
<br/><br/>

** __*Chronosphere*__ *spinning* *into* *existence*** 

Well well well, another uneventful month. I just remember taking a whole week off during the July 4 holiday to reset. I guess I also worked on a bunch of fight sticks to get ready for Street Fighter 6. I succesfully made one out of a cardboard box and played maybe an hour. Then a whole lot of unmemorable things happened. 

Hopefully, this month won't be as meh.
