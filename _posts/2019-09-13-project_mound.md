I am proud to say that I have been knocking out my project backlog for the past few weeks. It's at the point where I have amassed a bunch of hardware on my desk just waiting on documentation and demo videos so I can proudly shelve them. My motivation is high but so is my urge to procrastinate. There's really nothing stopping me from doing/finishing these things up. On the other hand, there is also nothing that is pushing me forward to get them done. 

‾\_(ツ)_/‾ It'll get done eventually; I can feel it!
