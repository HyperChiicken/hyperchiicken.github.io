When I cobble source code together I use a lot of copy-pasting, but writing everything from scratch needs a lot of touch typing skillz. Of course, I didn't take that class seriously back in grade school. "I could just look and type anyways," says my ignorant past self. So now I'm relearning how to type so it doesn't take years to program something. And what really bothers me is the mass amount of symbols assigned to the pinky. Like seriously, it's like they just threw the left over symbols all to the side. My poor right pinky :/
