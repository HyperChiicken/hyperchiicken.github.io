&ensp;&ensp;So I recently received hardware from Hackster.com after submittinga project proposal. It's shiny little Internet-of-Things (IoT) device called SmartEdge Agile. I've been playing around with it and I am able to get it up and running in a few tries.
One of the issues I had was parining the device to my phone. First it would link but unpairing it will cause the device to deny reconnections. The solution was this new thing I discovered for the device; it connects to the phone using bluetooth AND Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. That means that I had to connect it through the Brainium online portal for it to be linked to my phone. 
Thanks to the support line at Brainium for helping me resolve this issue. <b>:]</b>

&ensp;&ensp;There are other issues currently plaguing the device though like my gateway not connecting to the online portal and my device not updating to the latest firmware. <b><i>Urgh.</i></b> Hopefully this gets fixed soon.
Anyways, I did get to try the motion learning and recognition. It's neat that it can gather multiple sensor data along with the motion recognition in real time. <b><i>Cool!</i></b> Definitely will be playing around more with this thing 
once the software kinks are handled.

Update (05/15/2019): Got my connectivity issue fixed by lowering the IPv4 firewall protection settings on my router. Not the ideal fix but a fix nonetheless.
