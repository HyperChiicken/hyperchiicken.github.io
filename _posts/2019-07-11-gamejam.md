The Zero Words GameJam Vol.2 is the second iteration of the Zero Word gamejam. It starts this coming weekend. You can check it out here: https://itch.io/jam/zero-words-gamejam-2. The theme of the jam is to tell a story without the use of any words. This is definitely challenging, but it's a good place to start as it makes things simple. The approach is to tell the story through emotive characters and music. The story should also be simple to understand so I made a typical save the princess storyboard.

I'm going in as a newbie along with my brother as our first gamejam. He will be in-charge of sound while I do the rest. I'll be tackling this project with Godot as my game engine. Will definitely have to start from scratch and learn things throughout the weekend. Time to dig in some tutorials!

Goodluck to us. Let's see how this goes!
