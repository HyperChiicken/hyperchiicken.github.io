It's fascinating how time really passes you by if you lose a grip on it. It's like you're stuck on this treadmill called work if you don't hop off it; I guess I forgot to do that for the past 3 weeks. I got swallowed by the deadlines that doesn't seem to end. When one is done, another pops up! It's good cuz it always keeps you thinking/learning. The only drawback is that everything else becomes background. You get consumed by the work. I really thought I had a grip on things, but it's like I got pulled back to the same habit again. However, I'm more aware this time so I don't burn out. I try to be more efficient with my time and use overtime sparingly. At the end of the day though, all I can think about is the work ahead of me. The neverending deadlines. I heard meditation keeps you grounded in the "moment." So I'll be practicing meditating this week. 

This weekend was a bit productive; got to clean, tidy up, and build the last of my gunpla backlog (finally gunpla box free!). Now that the weekend is coming to an end; I feel dread but pumped for some reason. HERE WE GO! (Queue: My Hero Academia opening song#2)
