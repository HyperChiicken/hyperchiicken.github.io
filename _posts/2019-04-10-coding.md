Learning a new programming language can be tricky. The object-oriented thing is applicable, but the syntax is mostly different. I've been working on this project incorporating SNIPS.AI, which uses Python and an add-on(?) called Hermes. Hermes is basically linking text-to-speech (TTS) keyword capture to a Python script. Now I'm a Python noob, so I only have some reference code to work with. Adding the TTS complexity has made it harder for me to understand the language. The result is frustration. I mean it is part of the process. Still, not getting anything to work for days is disheartening. Sigh~ I gotta slog through it though, to make sure the future me becomes proficient in this thing.
