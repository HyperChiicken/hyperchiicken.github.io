Damn, it skipped another month. The time dilation transducer saturated somehow. There's still more work to be done to get this __*chronosphere*__ working properly. Anyways, last month was pretty uneventful. I took a week off to get rejuvinated, but I don't feel rejuvenated at all. I said to myself, "I'll be so productive this week and generate some content!" That didn't happen. I just ended up moving things around my home and lazed around scrolling through my phone ad nauseum. In the end, it was still a good pause from the grind. Going back to work isn't so daunting anymore though ever since I took charge of what I really wanted to learn. It's still helpful for my team, but entertaining and enriching to do at the same time. Someday, I'd like to find the motivation to finish my personal projects. Wherever you are... I'll find you...
