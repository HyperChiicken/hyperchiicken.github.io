And just like that, the 2023 is over. It was definitely another rollercoaster ride of emotions. Looking back, all I remember is that I really struggled emotionally and physically due to my progressive vision loss. It's gotten a lot worse that I really started considering what my future is like and not gonna be like. I needed help and got it. It's reassuring that there are a lot of people on my team supporting me in all aspects of my life. I don't think I would be making it to the end of the year mentally intact if it weren't for them. I hope this new year will lead me to a more vivid picture of what I really want to do for the remainder of my vision impaired life.
