Ahhh~ new year, new surgery. It hasn't been long since I had my cataract surgery, but here we go again. As a recap, my cornea started dying during the recovery phase after my cataract surgery. I've met with 2 new doctors since last time and now I'm scheduled for a cataract transplant. According to the interwebs, it costs around $13,000 to $28,000 -- HOLY GOLDEN COW!! That's like a new car right there. I just hope my insurance pays for it because that is a lot to take on. Speaking of a lot to take on, I'm prepping to be married this year. That's not cheap either... so yeah... sorry wallet.

Despite all the hardships I've been going through though, it's nice to have something positive happening in my life. I feel like I rarely get a win. Successive L's all around is hard to swallow. You can only take enough before you hit that point of no return. So I'll take any win. I'm sure there are more obstacles along the way, but I just gotta keep on doing my best one day at a time.
